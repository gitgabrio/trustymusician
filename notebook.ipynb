# Step 1 - Load and prepare data
Data are usually available as unstructure files with text (csv) or binary (parquet, avro) format and there are many libraries to load them from a local or remote storage.

After the loading step it is quite common to perform some preparation/cleanup actions: check domain boundaries, handle missing values, normalize strings, convert enumaration to number, etc.
